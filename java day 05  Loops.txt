Loops:
1. while loop
2. do while loop
3. for loop

1.while loop: 
It will be executed repeatedly as long as the condition remains true. Before 
executing body of the loop, the condition is checked whether it is true or not. Hence, it is 
called pre-testing loop. If condition is true, then body of the loop will be executed, till the 
condition becomes false. Otherwise, body of the loop is not executed.

Syntax:
while( condition )
{
// body of the loop;
}

2. do-while loop
It is similar to that of while loop except that it is executed at least once. So it is called 
as post-testing loop. The test of condition for repeating is done after each time boy of loop is 
executed. 
Syntax:
do
{
// body of loop;
} while ( condition );

 for loop
 It is a flexible control structure. The length of source code can be reduced by using 
“for” loop. The body of the loop is executed repeatedly till the condition is false. 
Syntax:
for( initialization ; condition ; incr/decr )
{
// body of loop;
}
